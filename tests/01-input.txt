Let me tell you about my typical day at school. Usually, we have six lessons a day. They begin at eight a.m. and they end at two forty five p.m.

I wake up at six thirty, take a shower, have breakfast and go to school. Normally, I am at school fifteen minutes before the lessons. I chat with my classmates and prepare for the first lesson.
